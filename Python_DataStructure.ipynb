        "# Python Data_structure\n",
        "\n",
        "1) What are data structures, and why are they important\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Data structures are fundamental concepts in computer science that organize and store data in an efficient and structured way. They define the relationships between data elements and the operations that can be performed on them.\n",
        "The choice of a data structure depends on the specific problem you're trying to solve and the operations you need to perform on the data. Using the right data structure can significantly impact the efficiency and performance of your code.\n",
        "Importance\n",
        "Efficiency: They allow for efficient storage and retrieval of data, reducing the time and resources required to access and manipulate data.\n",
        "Organization: They provide a structured way to organize data, making it easier to manage and understand complex relationships between data elements.\n",
        "Reusability: Many data structures are well-established and can be reused across different programming tasks, saving development time and effort.\n",
        "Problem Solving: Understanding data structures is crucial for designing efficient algorithms and solving complex problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples\n",
        "\n",
        "   ->  Mutable data types can be changed after they are created. This means you can modify their contents without creating a new object in memory.\n",
        "   example ; List , Dictionaries , Sets ,\n",
        "\n",
        "   Immutable data types cannot be changed after they are created. If you try to modify an immutable object, you will instead create a new object with the desired changes.\n",
        "   example ; Integers , Strings , Tuples.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Lists\n",
        "    -Mutable\n",
        "    -Defines using square brackets[]\n",
        "    -Slower for iteration aand acess due to overhead for mutability\n",
        "    -used for collection of items that need to be modified\n",
        "\n",
        "   ->Tuples\n",
        "   -Immutable\n",
        "   -Defines using paranthesis()\n",
        "   -Faster\n",
        "   -used for collection of items that should not be changed\n",
        "\n",
        "4)Describe how dictionaries store data\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->Dictionaries in Python store data as key-value pairs. Each key is unique and associated with a specific value. This structure allows for efficient retrieval of values based on their corresponding keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -Key-Value Pairs: The fundamental unit of storage in a dictionary is the key-value pair. The key acts as a unique identifier for the value. Keys must be immutable data types (like strings, numbers, or tuples containing only immutable elements), while values can be of any data type (mutable or immutable).\n",
        "\n",
        "  -Hashing: Dictionaries use a hash table (also known as a hash map) internally to store key-value pairs. When you add a key-value pair to a dictionary, Python calculates a hash value for the key. This hash value is used to determine where in the hash table the key-value pair should be stored.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -Hash Table Structure: A hash table is essentially an array of buckets or slots. The hash value of a key is used to map the key to a specific bucket in the hash table.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -Collision Handling: It's possible for different keys to have the same hash value. This is called a hash collision. When a collision occurs, dictionaries use various techniques to handle it, such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "  -Chaining: Storing multiple key-value pairs with the same hash value in a linked list within that bucket.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -Open Addressing: Probing for the next available slot in the hash table if the calculated bucket is already occupied.\n",
        "Efficient Lookups: When you try to access a value using its key, Python calculates the hash value of the key again and uses it to go directly to the corresponding bucket in the hash table. This makes dictionary lookups very efficient, with an average time complexity of O(1) (constant time), regardless of the size of the dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "5)Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   ->You might choose to use a set instead of a list in Python for several reasons, primarily due to the inherent properties of sets that make them more suitable for certain tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Here are the main reasons why you might prefer a set over a list:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Uniqueness: Sets automatically enforce uniqueness. They cannot contain duplicate elements. If you add a duplicate element to a set, it will be ignored. This is very useful when you need to work with a collection of distinct items and want to avoid duplicates without manually checking for them. Lists, on the other hand, can contain duplicate elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "  my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]\n",
        "  my_set = set(my_list)\n",
        "  print(my_list) # Output: [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]\n",
        "  print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3}\n",
        "  Membership Testing: Checking if an element is present in a set is significantly faster than checking for membership in a list, especially for large collections. This is because sets are implemented using hash tables, which provide average O(1) (constant time) complexity for membership testing. Lists, on the other hand, require iterating through the elements, resulting in O(n) (linear time) complexity in the worst case.\n",
        "\n",
        " import time\n",
        "\n",
        " large_list = list(range(1000000))\n",
        " large_set = set(large_list)\n",
        "\n",
        " start_time = time.time()\n",
        " print(999999 in large_list)\n",
        " end_time = time.time()\n",
        " print(f\"List membership test time: {end_time - start_time} seconds\")\n",
        "\n",
        " start_time = time.time()\n",
        " print(999999 in large_set)\n",
        " end_time = time.time()\n",
        " print(f\"Set membership test time: {end_time - start_time} seconds\")\n",
        " Mathematical Set Operations: Sets provide built-in support for mathematical set operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference. These operations are very efficient when performed on sets. While you can perform similar operations with lists, it would typically require more complex and less efficient code.\n",
        "\n",
        " set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n",
        " set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}\n",
        "\n",
        "print(set1.union(set2))         # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n",
        "print(set1.intersection(set2))  # Output: {3, 4}\n",
        "print(set1.difference(set2))    # Output: {1, 2}\n",
        "print(set1.symmetric_difference(set2)) # Output: {1, 2, 5, 6}\n",
        "Removing Duplicates: As mentioned earlier, sets are a very efficient way to remove duplicate elements from a collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6)What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.\n",
        "   A string can contain:\n",
        "\t•\tletters\n",
        "\t•\tnumbers\n",
        "\t•\tspaces\n",
        "\t•\tsymbols\n",
        "\n",
        "\t\t- A string is like a printed book: you can read it but can’t edit letters directly.\n",
        "\t  -\tA list is like a notebook: you can write, erase, edit anytime.\n",
        "\n",
        "7)How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   ->1. Immutability = Protection Against Accidental Changes\n",
        "\n",
        "If data shouldn’t change (like configuration values, coordinates, database records), a tuple guarantees that nobody will mess it up during runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Safer for Sensitive Data\n",
        "When you pass a tuple to a function, you can be 100% sure the data will not be modified inside that function.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Hashable & Usable as Dictionary Keys\n",
        "Only immutable objects can be hashable.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Tuples Prevent Logical Errors\n",
        "If your code relies on values never changing (like matrix dimensions, GPS coordinates, RGB values), tuples enforce that rule.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Better for Multi-Threading\n",
        "Because they can’t change, tuples are thread-safe.\n",
        "Multiple threads can use the same tuple without ruining each other’s data.\n",
        "Lists can get corrupted under multi-thread access.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. They Communicate Intent\n",
        "When a developer sees a tuple, it signals:\n",
        "“Don’t change this data.”\n",
        "That’s clarity + integrity in your program design\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "8)What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->A hash table is a data structure that stores key–value pairs and allows very fast lookup, insertion, and deletion — typically in O(1) average time.\n",
        "\n",
        "It works like this:\n",
        "\t1.\tYou give it a key.\n",
        "\t2.\tA hash function converts the key into a number (the hash).\n",
        "\t3.\tThat number maps to an index in an internal array.\n",
        "\t4.\tThe value is stored at that index.\n",
        "In Python, dictionaries (dict) are implemented using hash tables under the hood.\n",
        "Python:\n",
        "\t•\thashes \"name\"\n",
        "\t•\tfinds its index\n",
        "\t•\tstores \"Prasoon\" there\n",
        "\n",
        "9)Can lists contain different data types in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   ->Python is dynamically typed, which means a list doesn’t care what type of data you store inside it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike some strict languages (like Java/C++ arrays):\n",
        "\t•\tPython lists store references to objects, not raw values\n",
        "\t•\tThose objects can be anything\n",
        "So you’re free to mix:\n",
        "\t•\tint\n",
        "\t•\tfloat\n",
        "\t•\tstr\n",
        "\t•\tbool\n",
        "\t•\tlist\n",
        "\t•\ttuple\n",
        "\t•\tdict\n",
        "\t•\tcustom objects\n",
        "\n",
        "10)Explain why strings are immutable in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   ->In Python, strings cannot be changed after they are created.\n",
        "1. Security & Data Integrity\n",
        "\n",
        "Strings are used everywhere:\n",
        "\t•\tvariable names\n",
